This program executes few tasks
with the process time.

We calculate the waiting time for each task and
turn around time.

The first come first serve program executes the
tasks depending on their arrival order.

The first task should not wait, and hence the waiting task for the
first task should be zero.

Completion time is the total time the task 
has run on the processor.

Turnaround time is the difference betwween the 
completion time and the arrival time.

Waitng time is the differnce between the turn 
around time and the burst time.
