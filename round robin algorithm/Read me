Each task has burst time and arrival time. These are entered 
as input.
There is also quantum that is entered as input.
In the round robin method, each task is entered into
first in first out(FIFO) queue, and each task is executed in 
the processor for a quantum, if the task is not executed completely
then, the changes are saved for that task and the task is placed at the
end of the queue.
So, the waiting tme for the task is the time spent on the processor 
and the difference with the arrival time and the burst time.
The turn around time for each task is the addition of wait time and 
burst time.
