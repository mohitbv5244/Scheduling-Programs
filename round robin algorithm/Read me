Each task has burst time and arrival time. These are entered 
as input.
There is also quantum that is entered as input.
In the round robin method, each task is entered into
first in first out(FIFO) queue, and each task is executed in 
the processor for a quantum, if the task is not executed completely
then, the changes are saved for that task and the task is placed at the
end of the queue.
so, the completion time for each process is the time spent on the processor
after it has been executed finally.
The turn around time is the difference in the completion time and arrival time.
The waiting time is the difference in the turn around time and the burst time.
