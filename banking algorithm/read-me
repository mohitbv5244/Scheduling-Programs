the bankers algorithm checks whether the given number of processes
are in safe state or not depending on the values of resources.

The maximum allocation vector and the allocation vector with the
maximum resource vector are given, we need to calculate the need matrix
which is the difference between the maximum allocation matrix and the allocation matrix.

The available vector is the difference between the maximum resource vector and the allocation matrix.
So the porcess are considered to be in safe state only if the need matrix is greater than the available vector
and we keep updating the available vector whih is the addition of available vector with the allocation matrix.
