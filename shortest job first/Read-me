This program executes few tasks
with the process time.

We use slection sort to sort the process time.
Then we calculate the waiting time for each task and
turn around time.

The shortest job first program executes the
tasks depending on their arrival order.

However, the first task will execute depending on the
arrival time, but, the nex tasks are sorted according to
their burst time and then sheduled and executed.
