This program executes few tasks
with the process time.

We use slection sort to sort the priority.
Then we calculate the waiting time for each task and
turn around time.

The shortest job first program executes the
tasks depending on their arrival order.

However, the first task will execute depending on the
arrival time, but, the nex tasks are sorted according to
their priority and then sheduled and executed.


Completion time is the total time taken to execute the task.
Turn around time is the difference between the completion time and
the arrival time.
Waiting time is the difference between the turn around time and burst time.
